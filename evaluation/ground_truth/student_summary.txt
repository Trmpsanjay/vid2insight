* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Intelligent Agents

## Summary

This tutorial introduces LangChain, a modular framework designed to build applications leveraging large language models (LLMs). It explains LangChain’s core purpose and how it simplifies integrating tools and components when developing LLM-based applications. The tutorial covers interacting with models using prompts and chaining operations to create complex workflows.

LangChain offers significant advantages by abstracting complexity, though all functionalities can be coded manually in Python. It also discusses alternative frameworks such as LlamaIndex for retrieval-augmented generation use cases and LangGraph, CrewAI, and Microsoft’s offerings for agentic applications.

A practical demonstration shows LangChain usage with OpenAI models via a Python notebook. This includes securely loading API keys, creating chat completions with defined roles (system, user, assistant), sending queries to the model, and processing the responses effectively.

The tutorial introduces batch processing as a technique for handling multiple simultaneous users or generating multiple candidate responses, which enhances scalability.

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is explored through runnable class examples like `AddTen`, `MultiplyByTwo`, and `ConvertToString`, which can be chained together using the `|` operator to perform sequential operations. The role of `RunnablePassthrough` in passing inputs unchanged is also discussed.

Finally, the tutorial touches on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve response accuracy by combining LLMs with external data retrieval, and the development of intelligent agents using LangChain’s framework.
