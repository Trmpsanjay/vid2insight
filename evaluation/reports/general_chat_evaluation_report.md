## Sample Comparison

### Query 1: What is LangChain and what problem does it solve?
**Model Response:**
```
Okay, I understand. LangChain is a framework that simplifies building LLM-powered applications.
```

### Query 2: How do I load environment variables in the LangChain notebook?
**Model Response:**
```
LangChain simplifies building applications with LLMs by providing tools for model interaction, prompt engineering, dynamic workflows, RAG integration, and intelligent agent creation. You can load environment variables in a LangChain notebook by using `load_dotenv` from the `dotenv` library and `os.getenv` to retrieve the variables.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
