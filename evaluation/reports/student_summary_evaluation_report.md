## Topics Covered
- Introduction to LangChain and its purpose
- Working with Models and Prompts
- Chains and LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Batch Processing
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Intelligent Agents

## Summary
This presentation serves as a tutorial on LangChain, a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that use large language models (LLMs). It explains that LangChain is an abstraction built on top of other abstractions, aiming to make the integration of various tools and components easier. The tutorial covers several core aspects, including how to interact with models and prompts, how to create and use chains, and how to implement routing and memory for dynamic workflows. It also touches upon retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and building intelligent agents. The presenter compares LangChain to other platforms like LlamaIndex, LangGraph, and CrewAI, noting that these tools help improve prompt engineering for RAG an...

* Working with Models and Prompts
* LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
* Batch Processing
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Intelligent Agents

## Summary

This tutorial introduces LangChain, a modular framework designed to build applications leveraging large language models (LLMs). It explains LangChain’s core purpose and how it simplifies integrating tools and components when developing LLM-based applications. The tutorial covers interacting with models using prompts and chaining operations to create complex workflows.

LangChain offers significant advantages by abstracting complexity, though all functionalities can be coded manually in Python. It also discusses alternative frameworks such as LlamaIndex for retrieval-augmented generation use cases and LangGraph, CrewAI, and Microsoft’s offerings for agentic applications.

A practical demonstration shows LangChain usage with OpenAI models via a Python notebook. This includes s...
