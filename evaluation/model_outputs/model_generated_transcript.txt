The presentation is a tutorial about LangChain, a versatile framework for building applications that leverage large language models (LLMs). The presenter begins by saying that these systems are an abstraction on top of an abstraction. The presentation outlines the core purpose of LangChain, how to work with models, prompts, and chains, and how to implement routing and memory for dynamic workflows. It also covers retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), building intelligent agents, and the benefits of using LangChain. The tutorial aims to enable users to understand the core purpose of LangChain, work with models, prompts, and chains, implement routing and memory for dynamic workflows, integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and build intelligent agents. It emphasizes that LangChain is a versatile framework designed to simplify the integration of tools and components when building applications that use large language models, or LLMs. You can actually write all of these code by yourself using Python functions. According to the presenter, there's no real competition to Langchain but llama index. Llama index is another somewhat similar framework for rag use cases. Also, for agentic use cases, there is Lang graph, crew AI, and Microsoft has an offering. These platforms are all to help you write better prompts, because you need to get the prompts right for rag or agents. The presenter will be focusing on the core design in Lang Chain and building intelligent agents. The presentation then dives into a Python notebook, using Langchain with OpenAI. The notebook begins by loading necessary libraries such as `load_dotenv` from `dotenv` and `os`. It then proceeds to load environment variables from a `.env` file and retrieves the OpenAI API key using `os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")`. It prints the current working directory and a masked version of the API key for security. The notebook uses the `openai` library to create a chat completion. It defines a conversation with roles for \"system\", \"user\", and \"assistant\". The system role sets the context as a helpful assistant for BellaVista Italian Restaurant, and the user queries about the menu and vegan options. The assistant provides information about the restaurant's offerings. The presenter notes that this whole setup had been introduced by OpenAI. The presenter notes that without Langchain, you just tell the model that you're a helpful assistant specializing in providing information about the BellaVista Italian Restaurant. The user then asks what's on the menu, and if there are any vegan options. The notebook then outputs the API response, and the content confirms that BellaVista offers vegan options. The presenter is printing everything on the response that Open AI gives, which also includes how much token you have used. The presenter can go to choices and message and then print the content, which is what you would want to show. The presenter notes that this is a very common pipeline, regardless of who you're using. However, if you're going to use Langchain, Plancian has its own advantages in making things much easier for you. Text completion models have been deprecated. Langchain will still support anything that comes in 0.1. The presenter notes that you call the model with just a prompt, hey, tell me a joke, and then it gives you a joke. The presenter then moves on to batch processing, which can be really helpful if you have a lot of users to serve at the same time, or if you want multiple responses for the same basically you want multiple candidates, if you're familiar with beam search. The presenter notes that batch processing is heavily used in reeling. The presentation then moves on to a notebook on Langchain Expression Language, the notebook defines three classes: `AddTen`, `MultiplyByTwo`, and `ConvertToString`, all inheriting from `CRunnable`. The `AddTen` class adds 10 to the input data, `MultiplyByTwo` multiplies the input data by 2, and `ConvertToString` converts the input data to a string with a prefix \"Result:\". The next cell creates instances of these classes and chains them together using the `|` operator. Finally, the last cell invokes the chain with an initial value of 10 and prints the result. The presentation also shows the use of `RunnablePassthrough` which passes the input to the next runnable without modification.
