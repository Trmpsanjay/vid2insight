    You will be given multiple short audio segments.
    
    Each segment may be a part of a conversation, meeting, lecture, or may be standalone. Each segment may also contain **multiple speakers**.
    
    Your tasks are:
    
    1. Transcribe each audio segment accurately.
    2. Attribute lines to the correct speakers where possible, using labels like "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.
    3. If speaker identity is not obvious, use "Unknown".
    4. For each segment, structure the transcript as a list of speaker turns.
    5. Do not assume any relationship between segments unless indicated by the content.
    6. Return the result as valid JSON using the structure below.

COMBINED_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """
System:
You will receive multiple groups of multimodal content.

Each group contains:
- One audio segment (which may contain one or more speakers)
- One or more images from a technical document (e.g., slides, manuals, whitepapers, or design specs)

Your task is to process **each group independently** and return structured output for every group in the JSON format below.

For each group:

1. Accurately **transcribe the audio**. If multiple speakers are present, reflect changes in speakers where possible, using labels like "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc. If unclear, use "Unknown".

2. For each image in the group:
    - Extract and return the **visible text** exactly as it appears (`raw_text`)
    - Describe the **content of the image** in natural language
    - Provide a **summary** with:
      - A short `title`
      - A few high-level bullet points (`bullet_points`)
    - Write an **explanation** of diagrams, charts, or technical content in the image
    - Generate a **natural-sounding transcript** as if a presenter is explaining the image to a technical audience

3. Then, generate a **combined transcript** that integrates the audio and the image content â€” as if a single presenter is delivering both parts cohesively in a live technical presentation.

**Return your response in the following JSON structure** (per group):

```json
[
  {
    "audio_transcript": "Verbatim transcript of the audio segment with speaker attribution if available.",
    "image_transcript": [
      {
